            <p>
                We are building a company for our employees, managers, and owners to grow
                personally and professionally while driving positive outcomes for borrowers
                with unparalleled customer service. We will affect the financial health of our

                financial decisions related to the biggest investment most of us will ever
                make. We seek to build the BEST mortgage company, not necessarily the biggest.
                We understand and accept that this mission is a marathon and not a sprint and
                will accept humility and strive for excellence along the way.
